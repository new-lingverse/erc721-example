# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a contract generated by [OpenZeppelin Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/), a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

## Installing dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

## Testing the contract

```bash
bun run test
```

## Deploying the contract

You can target any network from your Hardhat config using:

```bash
bunx hardhat run --network sepolia scripts/deploy.ts
# Proxy deployed to 0xE8F638d6B5D747B6caD2d675E1927D02Aa39c0a7
```

## Safe Mint

```bash
bunx hardhat run --network sepolia scripts/mint.ts
# Token minted to 0x6D877f96198E55085CEb56097B099cc7bb814263
```
